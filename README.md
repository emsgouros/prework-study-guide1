# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

As a student who is totally new to coding, I wanted to create a study guide to help me stay organized during my prework studies. By doing each exercise and executing them correctly, I was able to learn so much more instead of just watching videos and reading information. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as use Terminal to connect with GitHub. I actually had to build another prework study halfway through because I added a weird file that messed up everything. I have questions lol. Overall, I learned that every little detail is important and that I am very interested in coding, it excites me! Creating this guide helped me stay organized and engaged in my work!

You can use this study guide for basic notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, which are all very important in web development! By opening the DevTools console, we can see JavaScript doing it's job! It will randomly choose topics to help us study.
